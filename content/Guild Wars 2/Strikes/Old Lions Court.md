## Shared Mechanics

### Danger Zone #general  
- Watchknight gains an shaped aoe and a defiance bar.
- Getting hit by the aoe dies
- Breaking the  CC will invert the aoe.
- Once their shield breaks and the aoe resolves, they take extra damage
- **Dont always break the bar!**

### Fixation #tank
- Watchknights fixate on the closest player
- Depending on phase, the fixate happens after Danger Zone, or after they land
- Going downstate moves the fixate to the closest person
- A special sound plays when fixated w/ a coloured diamond

- Target gets revealed and copy swiftness/superspeed to itself
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Vermillion</mark> & <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Arsenite</mark> are melee & <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Indigo</mark> is ranged. Indigo will never move.

### Boiling Aether #general #OLC-BoilingAether 
- Watchknights each have an attack that spawn a puddle thate xpands
- Once fully expanded, does heavy ticking damage
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Vermillion</mark>'s Gravity Hammer will spawn the puddle under the boss
	- Look for the red laser
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Arsenite</mark>'s Noxious Vapor Blade will spawn a puddle under the targetted player once the project hits them
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Indigo</mark>'s Tri-Bolt will give a player a tether that tps them back, the puddle will drop att heir previous location

## Watchknights' Attacks
- No conditions with any attacks, but high strike damage
### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Vermillion</mark>
#### Dual Horizon
**Known as:** In or Out
- Spawns a red ring around the boss
- White arrows will be pointing in/out or both
- Being in the red ring will Expose the player
- Players must stand on the sides with white arrows
- The white arrows are player based. 
- Each player not in the right spot causes a wave that does damage.
- When any other watchknight is spawned, the player fixated by the other one is exempt!

#### Gravity Hammer #tank #OLC-BoilingAether
- Whenever moving and not doing Dual Horizon, the boss will do a hammer chain
- The final strike will hurt more and do damage in an area
- The final strike will spawn Boiling Aether right under the boss
- The tank should try and keep gravity hammer on the edge of the arena. Once the puddle spawns, move!
## <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Arsenite</mark>
#### Pernicious Vortex #suction
- Boss spawns a red pool under itself and sucks in a player
- Telegraphed by aoe rings
- Standing in the pool will give Expose and deal damage
- Damage from the vortex increases the closer you are
- You can avoid the ticking damage with evasion
#### Noxious Vapor Blade #OLC-BoilingAether
- Furthest player from Arsenite will get a bright green tether
- Arsenite will send a green disc to the tethered player, and then spawn a Boiling Aether under them
- Helpful to have someone to bait it!
### <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Indigo</mark>
#### Crackling Wind #push
- Opposite of Pernicious Vortex
- Red ring will give Expose & heavy damage
- Damage increases the further you are away
- Can evade the ticking damage!
#### Tri-Bolt & Tether #OLC-BoilingAether
- Indigo will give 3x players an aoe
- Marked players must move away from each other quickly
- After the markers, one player will be marked with a blue tether mechanic
- Tether spawns where they are
- After a delay, the tether will snap a player back to the original position
- When the tether activates, it spawns a Boiling Aether where they were!
- Player should run to the edge to drop their aether and make use of the free teleport
